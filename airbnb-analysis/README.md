## 🏙️ London Airbnb Data Analysis

This project explores **Airbnb listings** in London to uncover patterns in pricing, availability, and host behavior. The dataset was sourced from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) and analyzed using Python (specifically **pandas** library) in a Jupyter Notebook.

### 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand what factors influence Airbnb listing performance and availability across different boroughs of London.

Specifically, the project investigates:
* Which neighborhoods have the highest average prices
* How availability and price vary by room type
* Who the top hosts are by number of listings
* How average prices differ across boroughs or districts
* How many listings have never been reviewed

### 🧠 Key Insights
* The analysis of London Airbnb listings shows that prices are heavily influenced by **location**, with central areas such as the **City of London** and **Lambeth** recording the **highest** average rates (above £370), while outer boroughs like Sutton and Harrow are far more affordable with average price below £100. <br>
* Among room types, **hotel rooms** have the **highest** average price at about £310.97 per night, followed by entire homes or apartments at roughly £256.60. Private rooms and shared rooms are much more affordable, averaging £120.02 and £83.64 respectively. **Availability also varies**, with shared rooms and hotel rooms tending to be open for more days in a year compared to entire homes/apartments and private rooms. <br>
* The most active host based on this analysis is **LuxurybookingsFZE**, managing 495 listings, which indicates a strong professional or commercial presence in the London Airbnb market. <br>
* Interestingly, **14,853 listings have never been reviewed**, hinting at low guest engagement or an oversupply of properties in some areas.
